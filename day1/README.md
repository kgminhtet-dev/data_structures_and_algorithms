# Day 1

### What is data structure?
- how the data is organized and stored to access the data effectively

### What is algorithm?
- the sequence of steps to accomplish a specified task
- transform the input to the output

### Complexity
- space complexity
  - the amount of memory for the algorithm to accomplish the task
- time complexity 
  - the amount of time for the algorithm to accomplish the task

### Time complexity
- Big O notation
- worst case scenario
- O(n) - linear time
- O(log n) - logarithmic time 
- O(n^2) - quadratic time
- O(2^n) - exponential time

### Test Driven Development
- Red - Test case
- Green - Pass
- Blue - Refactor

### AAA
- Arrange
- Act
- Assert
